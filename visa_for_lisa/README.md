## Task
The Problem is to create a machine learning model to predict loan acceptance for galaxy bank to help aid marketing campaign

## Description
Frist we have a loading, overview, cleaning and exploration of the dataset. Then we build acceptance
Logistic regression model which predicts the binary outcome for loan acceptance(yes or no/1 or 0)
We then evaluate the model performance and derive some key insights from the data

## Installation
The model has been saved to .pkl and can be deployed online by the DevOps team. We can alternatively use systems like streamlit to deploy

## Usage
The model accepts the data and predicts the target variable(Personal Loan) based on the independent variables
available in the dataset.
